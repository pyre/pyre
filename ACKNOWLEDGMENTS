    None of this would have been possible without Dan Meiron, Michael Ortiz, Mike Gurnis, and
    Brent Fultz, all of whom took a risk by supporting pyre at various stages in its
    development.

    Much of the current design of pyre is due to ideas and constructive criticism by Leif
    Strand.

    Raúl Radovitzky, Brad Aagaard and Patrick Hung taught me a lot about the needs of massively
    parallel applications.
    
    Jiao Lin has built a very sophisticated web-based application by stretching pyre beyond its
    limits and contributing countless use cases that have had a significant impact on the
    current implementation.

    Mike McKerns, Tim Kelly, Brandon Keith are early adopters and have made significant
    contributions to the usability of the package. Most of the existing documentation and user
    support over the past ten years has been possible thanks to their remarkable efforts.

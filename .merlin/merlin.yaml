# this workspace contains the following projects
# N.B.:
# - the {.prj} suffix is necessary only because {pyre} and {journal} are already known
#   to the {nameserver} as packages
# - the '#' in the name is required to denote that the list items are named instances
#   not types that must beinstantiated; awkward but necessary, for now; hnece the quotes...
projects:
  - "#journal.prj"
  - "#pyre.prj"
  - "#mpi.prj"

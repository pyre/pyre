# the {pyre} project contains
pyre.prj:
    # a library; note the '#' in the name that tells the configuration store to look
    # for a component by that name
    libraries: "#libpyre"

# the library
libpyre:
    # the name of the library; it is used to build the archive and shared object names
    # e.g., on linux, the archive will be called libpyre.a and the shared object libpyre.so,
    # whereas on macOS we'll get libpyre.a and libpyre.dylib
    name: pyre
    # the location of the library sources relative to the root of the project
    root: lib/pyre
    # language specific configuration
    languages.cxx.dialect: c++17

    # optional external dependencies; a dependency can be marked optional if the source code
    # structure is flexible enough to accommodate its absence; see the special configuration
    # section below for ways to exclude portions of the source tree when a dependency is missing
    request:
        - hdf5

# special configuration for select assets
# the h5 folder contains code that depends on {libh5}
lib/pyre/h5:
    # skip it unless its requirements are satisfied
    require: hdf5

# similarly, the h5 gateway header
lib/pyre/h5.h:

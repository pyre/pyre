# class declaration
class Plexus(Application):
    """
    Base class for applications that interpret their first non-configurational command line
    argument as an action that should be executed.

    As an example of such an app, consider {merlin}. Invoking

        merlin version

    causes the {merlin} plexus to locate an action named {version} and invoke it.

    Subclasses are expected to declare a class variable {pyre_action} that points to a subclass
    of the {Action} protocol defined in this package. This responsibility is left to subclasses
    so that there is no bias on the category names of the actions induced by a choice of family
    name by the framework. This way the language used to specify the actions and their behavior
    can remain natural to the context of the application.

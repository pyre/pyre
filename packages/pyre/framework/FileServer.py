    The manager of the virtual filesystem

    Instances of {FileServer} manage hierarchical namespaces implemented as a virtual
    filesystem. The contents of these namespaces are retrieved using URIs, and can be arbitrary
    objects, although they are typically either local or remote files.

    The framework uses a {FileServer} instance to decouple the logical names of resources from
    their physical locations at runtime. For example, during the bootstrapping process the
    framework looks for user preferences for pyre applications. On Unix like machines, these
    are stored in '~/.pyre' and its subfolders. The entire hierarchy is mounted in the virtual
    filesystem under '/-/user'. This has the following advantages:

    * applications can navigate through the contents of '/-/user' as if it were an actual
      filesystem

    * configuration settings that require references to entries in '/_/user' can now be
      expressed portably, since there is no need to hardwire actual paths

    Applications are encouraged to lay out their own custom namespaces. The application
    developer can refer to resources through their standardized logical names, whereas the user
    is free to provide the mapping that reflects their physical location at runtime.

class CommandLineParser:
    """
    Support for parsing the application command line

    The general form of a command line configuration event is
        --key=value
    which creates a configuration event that will bind {key} to {value}.

    This implementation supports the following constructs:
        --key
            set key to None
        --key=value
        --key.subkey=value
            key may have an arbitrary number of period delimited levels
        --(key1,key2)=value
            equivalent to --key1=value and --key2=value; an arbitrary number of comma separated
            key names are allowed
        --key.(key1,key2)=value
        --key.(key1,key2).key3=value
            as above; this form is supported at any level of the hierarchy

    By default, instances of the command line parser use the following literals
        '-': introduces a configuration command
        '=': indicates an assignment
        '.': the separator for multi-level keys
        '(' and ')': the start and end of a key group
        ',': the separator for keys in a group

    If you want to change any of this, you can instantiate a command line parser, modify any of
    its public data, and invoke "buildScanners" to recompute the associated regular expression

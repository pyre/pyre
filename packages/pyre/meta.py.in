    This work has been funded in part by the U.S. Department of Energy, the
    National Science Foundation, the National Nuclear Safety Administration,
    the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Orthologue, and
    ParaSim.

    None of this would have been possible without Dan Meiron, Michael Ortiz,
    Mike Gurnis, Brent Fultz, Mark Simons, and Paul Rosen, all of whom took a
    risk by supporting pyre at various stages in its development.

    Much of the current design of pyre is due to ideas and constructive
    criticism by Leif Strand.

    Raúl Radovitzky, Brad Aagaard and Patrick Hung taught me a lot about the
    needs of massively parallel applications.

    Jiao Lin has built a very sophisticated web application framework by
    stretching pyre beyond its limits, and contributing countless use cases
    that have had a significant impact on the current implementation.

    Mike McKerns, Tim Kelly and Brandon Keith were early adopters and have
    made significant contributions to the usability of the package. Most of
    the existing documentation and user support over the years has been
    possible thanks to their remarkable efforts.
